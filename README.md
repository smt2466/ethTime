#ethTime
This app converts your local time to Ethiopian Time. Ethiopia is a country in Africa with UTC+3. It also gives you the time the locals use that is different from the 24 hour version of time count we are normally used to. It doesn't use the concept of AM or PM rather it's a 12 hour count(12 hours daylight, 12 hours nighttime).
